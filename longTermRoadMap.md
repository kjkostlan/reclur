Immersion track:
    Non-intrusive but satisfying sound-effects for UI and actions.
    User-defined achievement system?
    More smooth animations?
    Multi-finger scrolling?
    Different themes to cater to different moods.
    Expensive code emits smoke like an overheated engine.
    Long contracted code "warning, under pressure".

Feature track (speculative list as problems are hard):
    Python, Java, C(++), Haskell support.
    Network visulization of code.
    Allow (simple) edits on macro expanded code (some sort of data-flow analysis)
    Incomplete infinite loop detector (it won't ever catch all loops, but we have crossed the valley of life).
    Type-injection "if x is an int y is an ...".
    More complex dataflow analysis to track down features.

Security track:
    Make code macros resonably safe, i.e. some sort of are you sure you want to run macros.
