Motivation:
    Restore a workflow context that hasen't been done in a while.
    Behavior is determined by limitations to a large extent.
        i.e. slow C++ compiler vs repl.
    Solve a new problem that requires context, but used in a different way.
        Plot graphs, but to remember where the data and code was, newest versions of code, etc.
        "I forgot where that was" <- Make this NOT be a limiting factor.
        Use lots of cues to maximaly reinforce the memory.
            SPATIAL!
Specific features (TODO's):
    PRIORITY: ::namespace-qualified-names
    PRIORITY: Optimize performance (graphics).
    PRIORITY: Save and restore states (with a minor kludge for fn).
    Chrome tab browser like navigation.
    Tab browser tweaks:
        User defines a leaf.
        Leafs can do anything, like open a video, etc.
