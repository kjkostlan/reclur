Performance gain in the ctrl+P printout (use the (fast) FSM parser to find the outer form, then use the (slow) full parser on said form).
Quit handling.
Save app state when loading.
Delete box defaults to "no".
Paredit or some system that can accomplish a similar thing.
Stack traces for error messages have lots of extra junk need to remove when printing.
Make the ctrl+P printout-debugging more user friendly (when I start using it, probably will have a complaint)?
Better ::namespace-qualified-names (partially implemented already, but can be improved. Don't use for common tags referred to across many namespaces).
Less battery usage (if this is doable easily, very minor problem currently).
Autocomplete feature for code entry (with back-end database).
Macro expansion (an extra viewer or part of codebox?).
Tab browsing navigation (requested by bmillare), with leaves that can open vids et al.
