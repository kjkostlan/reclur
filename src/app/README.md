The core UI code is here. javax.swing.* is a world with pervasive mutation, so it simply proved too much work to fit into a "gui as data" immutable paradigm. Instead, we coded simple (space efficient) components from scratch. Other advantages of this are the "rich text" in rtext.clj as well as the large virtual desktop, both of which would be difficult with swing. Finally, we are less dependent on java itself and could more easily migrate to a browser-based version powered by clojure-script, though such a migration is not currently planned.
