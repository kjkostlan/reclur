Pain points that come up when coding.
Most can be fixed. 
Some of these can be fixed with standard features, some will require weird and wonderful features.
----

(x8) Forgot name, needed to scroll up in the function, took time.

(x2) Not knowning the structure of various arguments of functions, so having to look it up.

Tricky code detail that took a little while to find it.

A refactor got tedious having to combine different functions from various places in two files.

Having to keep trying a command over and over again while debugging.

(x11) No link to errors.

(x7) nullpointer exceptions and class cast exceptions stop showing stack traces after a few times.

(x6) Having to adjust every setup of the app when it restarts.

(x2) Not having good tools to navigate stack traces.

Printouts on a function that run every frame make a mess.

Exceptions on different threads appear in different places.

No find replace (OK this is just stupid).

(x5) Forgetting what task I was on after a break.
